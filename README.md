# Project:
This project tackles the question "Is there a correlation between Air Pollution Emissions and the Personal Income of Individuals in Victoria? "

We collected data from Data.gov.au(central source of Australian open government data) and Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Through data wrangling and the use of pearson correlation and linear regression, we try to explain the impact of personal income to sulfur dioxide emissions in Victoria, Australia.
